# Mailspool importer for MacOS X spotlight

This is a source and programs for importing Mailspools into spotlight.
For details, please refer `README.en` included in this directory.

## Warning

As of MacOS 10.9, this program no longer works.

This importer is dependent on ruby 1.8, and 'tmail' and 'iconv' used
in this program are a bit obsolete libraries. It should be re-written
for 'mail' library and make it compatible with ruby 2.0 to work with
MacOS 10.9.

The source codes are put into github, under the permission of original
author, hoping someone to re-write them to be compatible with newest
MacOS X.
